# MobileInsightConverter
## FALL 17 CS 211 Project

### Introduction 
This project aims to parse and analyze the logs generated by MobileInsight(http://www.mobileinsight.net)
to be able to calculate the up-link and down-link overall latency.

### Getting Started 
Simply download this zip all together to you local drive and
install MobileInsight as well. Detail instructions about installing 
MobileInsights can be found here (http://www.mobileinsight.net)

### Prerequisites
This program must be run under python 3 and this project must be 
used with mobileinsight-core together to be able to give latency result 

### How to use it 

First you have to use MobileInsight to convert binary log files(.ml2log) into xml text-file version log file.
The way to do that is using the MSGLogger in mobileinsight-core.
Then manually add \<data> at the beginning of that text file and append \</data> at the end as well.
When you get the log file, now go to src folder 

```angular2html
    cd src
```
suppose you want to run down-link analyzer just type 

```angular2html
    python3 dl_tx_delay_analyzer.py full/path/to/xml-txt-log_file
```

same procedure for up-link latency 

```angular2html
    python3 ul_tx_delay_analyzer.py full/path/to/xml-txt-log_file
```


### Example of Down-Link Result 

```angular2html
    ...
    77779 , 77779 , 77779 , 1 , RLC_real_time 49:12.738035 , PHY_real_time 49:12.863162
    897 1720.0
```
897 is number of packets and 1792 is overall latency in ms
