# MobileInsightConverter

FALL 17 CS 211 Final Project

dl_tx_delay_analyzer.py: 
The downlink transmission delay analyzer. It only runs for a text file that contains XML format data.
We first generate a mobileinsight log(.ml2log) and convert it into a .txt file using the MSGLogger in ./examples(remember to add <data> </data> in the beginning/end of the log.
Change the filename in main() to your own \<logname\>.
